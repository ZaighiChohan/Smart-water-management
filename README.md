# Smart-water-management
This project uses Big Data techniques to analyze and visualize water management data. By analyzing lakes data, we aim to predict water conditions, detect patterns, and contribute to smart water management solutions. The project includes data cleaning, machine learning models, and interactive visualizations to support water management decisions.
